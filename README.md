## Overview

This paper proposes a humane, mastery‑first alternative to mass homework: the Scholastic Pact on Temporal Non‑Aggression paired with a decentralized “Symphony of Agents.”

Key ideas:
- Replace time‑on‑task with verifiable mastery (just‑in‑time interventions instead of mass assignments).
- Orchestrate learning via autonomous agents (Student, Curriculum, Mentor, Well‑being).
- Use permissioned DLT to issue portable, tamper‑evident mastery credentials.
- Coordinate resources through Beacon selection (micro‑help) and FIPA Contract Net (high‑stakes).
- Launch with a Minimum Viable Ecosystem (one school, one subject) and scale organically.

## Highlights

- Evidence: Diminishing returns from homework; well‑being and equity harms.
- Architecture: BDI cognition for agents; FIPA‑ACL for communication; hybrid Beacon/CNP orchestration.
- Trust layer: Permissioned DLT + DHT for resilient, privacy‑preserving records.
- Practice: Clear roles, example learning flow, and an MVE plan for real‑world pilots.
